	Hello !<br />
	The main idea was to design an app capable of receiving (and sending) data from/to devices all around the world (wristbands, cellphones, ...)
	and store that properly into a MySql database. This was the <b>Web Service</b> part.
	<br />
	The administrator would then use the <b>Manager App</b> to check the status of all the users that did send him data.
	Noticeably, he will be able to add/remove/edit users, and show the data that has been sent using raw data or graphs.
	<br />
	Following concepts have been learned or discovered programming this :
	<ul>
		<li>Tomcat configuration</li>
		<li>Scala language, even though I'm far from being an expert</li>
		<li>Finally adopt sbt !</li>
		<li>Lift (Wiring, SessionVars, LiftScreen, Mapper, JsCmds, RESTHelpers, Widgets...)</li>
		<li>Finding documentation for Lift...</li>
		<li>The philosphy behind (and basic usage of !) CouchDB</li>
		<li>Eating my nails down to the veins</li>
	</ul>
	Enjoy !
