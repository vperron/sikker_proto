/*****************************************************************************/



DONE
====
OK : - First version of REST interface
OK : - CouchDB and MySQL Models for persistence, working
OK : - Lift Web interface to add/edit/view/remove users
OK : - Improve REST interface and create a bracelet program that will connect


MAJOR FEATURES
==============
- Connect couchDB and mysql to get bracelet informations live
    * At least a table with last information update
		* At best, graphs


MINOR FEATURES
==============
- Still minor bugs in page count when filter is on
- Maybe better if we had a per-column sorting feature for users
- Could be nice to try ScalaCheck features on some parts
