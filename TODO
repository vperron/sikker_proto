MAJOR FEATURES
==============


MINOR FEATURES
==============
- Still minor bugs in page count when filter is on
- Maybe better if we had a per-column sorting feature for users
- Could be nice to try ScalaCheck features on some parts
- Improve performance to have less couchDB calls on user list
- Graph isn't yet properly drawn, scale is bad and does not render
  actual user values
